The more detail you give, the better the results.  The \"Realistic\" style is specified to ensure the image aligns with a documentary-style video.\n\n* **ContentText:** This field contains the narration or text overlay for that scene in the video.  This text should be concise and easily digestible within the timeframe of a short video segment.\n\n**To create the 30-second video:**\n\n1. **Use an AI image generator:**  Feed each `imagePrompt` to your chosen AI art generator to get high-quality images.  Adjust parameters like aspect ratio (widescreen is recommended for video) as needed.\n\n2. **Video editing software:**  Import the generated images into a video editing software (e.g., Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, iMovie, Kapwing).\n\n3. **Add narration:**  Add the text from the `ContentText` field as voiceover or text overlay using your video editing software.\n\n4. **Transitions and timing:**  Add smooth transitions between images and adjust the duration of each scene to fit within the 30-second timeframe.  Aim for roughly 4-5 seconds per scene.\n\n5. **Music and sound effects:**  Include appropriate background music and sound effects to enhance the mood and storytelling.\n\n\nThis JSON provides a structured foundation.  You might need to adjust the number of scenes and the content text to precisely fill 30 seconds depending on your chosen pace and voiceover speed.  Remember to experiment with different AI image generators and video editing techniques to achieve the best results.\n"},
